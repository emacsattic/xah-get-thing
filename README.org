This emacs lisp package provides functions similar to `thing-at-point' of `thingatpt.el'.

[[http://melpa.org/#/xah-get-thing][file:http://melpa.org/packages/xah-get-thing-badge.svg]]

They get “things” independent of syntax table, so you always get same thing regardless what's current major mode.

And they allow you to get text selection when there's active region.

See home page at http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_get-selection-or-unit.html
